# Development Plan

## Base Mechanics
- Network of waypoints with a basic market at each
- Each waypoint represents a single solar system with a single trading point and associated market value.
- Single ship per player with cargo space to transfer goods between waypoints
- Transit times of real life hours
- Imperfect information: have to travel to a system to gain market info.
- Data stored: world info (locations, market info) & player info (assets, ships)

## More complex Additions
- Fuel usage
- Health
- Player fleets
- Info can be traded with other players.
- Info must be transported like cargo
- Different ship types (speed/cargo tradeoff, fuel efficiency)
- Resources that can be obtained from a system depend on its planet types
- Store money on ships instead of on the player (since information is slow)

## Fancy Stuff
- Tourism
- 'Quests' - e.g. deliver a specific cargo to a specific spot for a higher return than usual
- Random events
- Multiple waypoints per system
- Invest in specific waypoints to alter/increase output
- Resource extraction in empty systems
- Set up new waypoints?

## Miscellaneous
- Fuel extracted from gas giants
- Spice and paperclips as tradable goods

# Other Ideas

## FTL
- Mass Phase Drive: The mass of the ship is dimensionally phased, greatly boosting velocity, and allowing for FTL travel. Default.
- Subspace generator: The ship is shifted into a subspace bubble, allowing for greater speeds. Average ongoing energy cost, but high initial cost to generate the bubble.
- Wormhole generator: Requires fixed generators at each end. No energy cost for ship, but typically monetary cost.
- Fold Teleport Drive: Requires very complex, costly calculations, done prior to jump. Typically slower than other methods, but can be done while docked at a station.
- Hyperspace Jack: Allows for using hyperspace lines, left by some ancient civilisation. Very fast and cheap, but the lines are rarely conveniently located.
